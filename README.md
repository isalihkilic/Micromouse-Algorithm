# Micromouse-Algorithm
A working maze solving algorithm for micromouse, written in Python (just for fun, won't use Micropython in competitions.). Utilizing floodfill algorithm for pathmaking and open-closed maze to detect if the solution found is the shortest possible path. It has some serious problems with performance.
